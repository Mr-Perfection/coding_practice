The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after NN growth cycles?
//2 cycles/year -> 2 cycles are spring and summer -> height + 1m / summer & 2* height / spring

T = test cases
N = # of cycles

ex) N = 0 Height = 1// initially the height of the tree is 1.
	N = 1 Height = 2// Spring cycle. X2	
	N = 2 Height = 3// Summer +1	
	N = 3 Height = 6// Spring
	N = 4 Height = 7
