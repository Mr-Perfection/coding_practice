Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(n/2) times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.



test cases:

Input : [2, 1, 2]
Return  : 2 which occurs 2 times which is greater than 3/2 (1). 

2 2 1 6 3 
n = 5
floor(5 / 2) = 2
5, 6 , 3 > 2 , 3 is the next greater number.

m = n /2  = 2

2 2 1 6 3 
store…
[6, 3] //greater than m

find the min?
3
lets try…
