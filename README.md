# coding_practice

## Welcome to my coding pratice repository!
These folders/files are all the coding challenges/pratice that I have done mostly in Java programming language. 
Most of the coding problems are done from Hackerrank.
Unfortunately, recruiters and hiring managers do not even consider candidates without passing the coding challenges they send you via Hackerrank (or others). I know, some of these algorithms are unnecessary for some software jobs but I think once you get a solid job experience I do not think we need these anymore. Well, I don't disagree with you that coding challenge or whiteboard coding interview is a bs and does not identify how good you as a candidate. I hope one day we can identify candidates with the resumes and better interview format. I think they should score based on a combination of coding skills, personality, and how motivated/dedicated you are to the company instead of just strictly how goot at coding... Rockstar coder who is a psychopath or anti-socialist? Hmmm... This is my opinion at least. Maybe I will understand better once I start hiring software talents... Anyways, sorry for the rant and use this as your reference to help yourself improve to be better at algorithms and data structures. I will try to update as I do more coding problems. Any feedbacks or if you find better approaches, I am happy to hear from you. Check me out on Twitter (@Stephen_S_Lee)
