# coding_practice

Welcome to my coding pratice repository!
These folders/files are all the coding challenges/pratice that I have done mostly in Java programming language. 
Most of the coding problems are done from Hackerrank.
Unfortunately, recruiters and hiring managers do not even consider candidates without passing the coding challenges they send you via Hackerrank (or others). I've been very frustarted by this current situation... Anyways, use this as your reference to help yourself improve to be a better coder. I will try to update as I do more coding problems. Any feedbacks or if you find better approaches, I am happy to hear from you. Check me out on Twitter (@Stephen_S_Lee)
